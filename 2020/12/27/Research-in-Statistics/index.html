        <p>Statistics has been used in a wide range includes the application on sports. A number of critics seriously doubt how the statistics help with investigating the value and how much the value of statistics it self is useful for the investigation. Since there are many statistics out there that people have the capacity to create a logical link to predict whether the given season can have significant impact on the performance of a player or a team. </p>
<p>Over the last game on the basketball match NBA in 2020 Lakers won over the Nuggets while Heat won Celtics of the Conference finals. However, does this mean Lakers is better than the Nuggets or does the Celtics being influenced by specific situations during the tournament so that it lost the game in a very low difference? Without the precise statistics and evaluation on a certain occasion of a variety of variables we cannot make sure which one is better, since the evaluation not only limits to the score, but also relates to the individual player as well as the cooperation and back-behind finances support.</p>
<p>Phil Jackson, an America former basketball player professionally, argued that “The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.”(Basketball quote, goodreads). This opinion emphasized on an interactive relationship between the individual player and the team as a whole, which represents that it’s not so simple to only put the sights on a specific score or single tournament.</p>
<p>However, there is still doubt on statistics, whether it can be totally trust and used by coaches and the audiences. The opinion hold against the statistics is not only limited in the sports, but also in many fields since the inaccuracy of statistics also have been proved through these fields. “Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable.”quoted from Mark Twain, partly proved that the statistics results can be twisted by people.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to prove that statistics can be effectively used in evaluating the economic affairs and finances in basketball, in the following essay I will list a diversity of research on the performance of players and teams in different aspects by statistics method.</p>
<p>1.2 Aim and rationale<br>I have been a basketball girl since i was in the primary school, with twice training a week and several tournaments made me fall in love with this game. Basketball is not only a sport which can help me strength my body but also help me with making more friends. Despite being a player of our school basketball team, I also concerned about the clubs and teams in the world tournament. However, as I watching the games and tournaments, I realized that there are hundreds of games process at the same time, so many clubs around the world, it will be much more convenience these information together by analyzing statistics.</p>
<p>When I watched the tournament, there were always sometimes my favorite team lost, and the players get hurt. By contrast, as I considered about the result before the tournament ended, sometimes I got wrong that I thought myself would be definitely be right during predicting which team would win or lose. For instance, in the play off 8/15/20, game 4 round, Thunder and Rocket only had very small difference in the score, I expected Rockets to win since Rivers played so well, but out of my expectations, Thunder won the game in the last chance. That was the time I began to think: is it a team’s value totally rely on the team member? Or the value of a team really on limited to the score and result? How to motive the team members when they lose in the good and bad times? </p>
<p>Hence, the debates on value of sports statistics would be discussed in the essay.<br>1): To what extent the budgets effect player’s performance on the field? Does high budgets really represent high score?<br>2) How to analyze a basketball player’s performance by the shooting skills and percentage?<br>How to prevent the rate of injuries of the individual player in order to maintain their further value on the next tournament</p>
