            <p>My name is Lorena. I am a high-school visual artist and a trial competitor who is passionate about law. I am easy-going since, in my opinion, its of paramount importance to establish good relationships between friends and clients. I always respect everyone around me because I think different ideas can help me improve in a variety of ways. Listening to a range of people is especially important for me as I want to be a lawyer in the future, </p>
<p>As for my family and friends, they describe me as a popular leader who takes charge whenever I work in a team. My teammates comment that I am pretty relaxed in general, however, sometimes its easy for me to lose my patience since I always set high standards for both my friends and myself; if someone fails my expectations in the team I will lose my temper, but I can soon recover control in order to encourage my teammates.</p>
<p>In addition, I am proud of some of my qualities, and the most important one is perseverence. No matter what difficulties I meet, even if I feel defeated from time to time I can still stand up and fight back; not only in school affairs but also in boxing, chess and writing.</p>
<p>In addition to these qualities, I also have a special understanding of credit capital which has affected the world economy recently. My interest in as well as my analysis of political affairs make me different from my peers; since I can organize my ideas rapidly with a clear logical link. I consider that to have thoughts on world matters should be encouraged. Moreover, I can use my flair for analysis when I read articles in The Economist or New York Times. Looking for flaws in logic in these publications is one of my favorite hobbies. </p>
<p>All in all, I admire those authors whose articles are published in world famous newspapers, and I have the desire to become one of them some day. I like to think about a problem from different perspectives, therefore, if there is a debate, I will be a good debater for both sides due to my study of dialecticThe art of determining the truth by the logical exchange of ideas and opinions is a basic need for a good counsel as well.</p>

            <p> This week I have seen a new TV drama called the silk, recording the real life of how a normal lawyer get on well with her daily affairs. I always dream about be a counsel in the future, therefore I thought this TV series was helpful at first, but it’s more interesting than I thought in the beginning. </p>
<p>In this series, there are an amount of dimensions of lawyers’ life shown to the audience. The most intriguing part should be on court, because I have passion on researching the battles between witnesses and the lawyer. Counsel has to lay out the questions, like setting a trap, waiting for the witness to tell all the details, and find out where the problem was. </p>
<p>For instance, when Martha, the main character(a counsel). asking about if the witness is being raped or not, she did not ask her directly at first. Instead, she questioned where the witness were(at home), when she was doing at that time(showering), and asking about the relationship between her and her ex-boy friend. Actually, the ex and the witness had an appointment at witness’s house, so the problem is, why the witness knew her ex will come, but doing shower at that time? Why she didn’t dress up but only with a towel on when she opened the door? That is where the question came out.</p>
<p>Moreover, the series also shed some lights on the daily life of lawyers, their trouble and work in the office, the relationship between the colleges and how to deal with them. Sometimes you only have 1 day to prepare a case; and sometimes you have to replace your college when they are ill.</p>
<p>Another point is, it seems that the questions that were asked on the court were more simple than in the mock trial. I thought it is a good method to get the point, to make the points clear and straight forwards, without looking at the notes, that is really cool. I will try this method in this year’s tournament.</p>

            <p>this week I have participated in the Mock trial friendship tournament with our main campus on the afternoon of the last day of 2020. During this time, I led a team which consisted of one of my classmates  and my juniors. I taught these juniors by myself with my own team members for the whole semester. By the way, we had our first school official team for Mock trial in 2020 as well, led by me, will face the 2021winter tournament together, in order to get the chance to be the judge next year in summer.  While in this case, I portrayed as the lawyer for a expert witness who helped the defense, whom to prove the defense wasn’t negligent for the death of an athlete. I also did the openings statement as well, band 8 score out of 10, and got a lot of 8s in other process such as in the direct examination and the cross examination. Moreover, I made several objections to the plaintiff’s witness when they said something more prejudicial than probation，or just simply hearsay. Also, speculation has to be concerned because it is easy to miss out such statements.<br>I got the top 1 outstanding lawyer in this case, and I hope I can do well in the winter tournament.</p>

            <p>Statistics has been used in a wide range includes the application on sports. A number of critics seriously doubt how the statistics help with investigating the value and how much the value of statistics it self is useful for the investigation. Since there are many statistics out there that people have the capacity to create a logical link to predict whether the given season can have significant impact on the performance of a player or a team. </p>
<p>Over the last game on the basketball match NBA in 2020 Lakers won over the Nuggets while Heat won Celtics of the Conference finals. However, does this mean Lakers is better than the Nuggets or does the Celtics being influenced by specific situations during the tournament so that it lost the game in a very low difference? Without the precise statistics and evaluation on a certain occasion of a variety of variables we cannot make sure which one is better, since the evaluation not only limits to the score, but also relates to the individual player as well as the cooperation and back-behind finances support.</p>
<p>Phil Jackson, an America former basketball player professionally, argued that “The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.”(Basketball quote, goodreads). This opinion emphasized on an interactive relationship between the individual player and the team as a whole, which represents that it’s not so simple to only put the sights on a specific score or single tournament.</p>
<p>However, there is still doubt on statistics, whether it can be totally trust and used by coaches and the audiences. The opinion hold against the statistics is not only limited in the sports, but also in many fields since the inaccuracy of statistics also have been proved through these fields. “Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable.”quoted from Mark Twain, partly proved that the statistics results can be twisted by people.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to prove that statistics can be effectively used in evaluating the economic affairs and finances in basketball, in the following essay I will list a diversity of research on the performance of players and teams in different aspects by statistics method.</p>
<p>1.2 Aim and rationale<br>I have been a basketball girl since i was in the primary school, with twice training a week and several tournaments made me fall in love with this game. Basketball is not only a sport which can help me strength my body but also help me with making more friends. Despite being a player of our school basketball team, I also concerned about the clubs and teams in the world tournament. However, as I watching the games and tournaments, I realized that there are hundreds of games process at the same time, so many clubs around the world, it will be much more convenience these information together by analyzing statistics.</p>
<p>When I watched the tournament, there were always sometimes my favorite team lost, and the players get hurt. By contrast, as I considered about the result before the tournament ended, sometimes I got wrong that I thought myself would be definitely be right during predicting which team would win or lose. For instance, in the play off 8/15/20, game 4 round, Thunder and Rocket only had very small difference in the score, I expected Rockets to win since Rivers played so well, but out of my expectations, Thunder won the game in the last chance. That was the time I began to think: is it a team’s value totally rely on the team member? Or the value of a team really on limited to the score and result? How to motive the team members when they lose in the good and bad times? </p>
<p>Hence, the debates on value of sports statistics would be discussed in the essay.<br>1): To what extent the budgets effect player’s performance on the field? Does high budgets really represent high score?<br>2) How to analyze a basketball player’s performance by the shooting skills and percentage?<br>How to prevent the rate of injuries of the individual player in order to maintain their further value on the next tournament</p>

            <p>The dry flowers which represent the end of life in a deadly beauty, that is, even if these flowers withered after blossomed, they still remain a sense of elegant for people to cherish. I considered that these dried flowers in relation to death, and I made two of them into a cross section in front of the sunflower.<br>The cross-section I made in relation to religious means, that is to say, the cross actually metaphor the crucifixion which locked the sunflower. If the sunflower is prevented to produce sunlight, then there would be no lights for the world, and that is the reason why could behind are darker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DG1Xy8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/22/DG1Xy8.jpg" alt="DG1Xy8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>However, what I want to say is not that the religion doesn’t exist lights, by contrast, just the belief gives us life meanings and hope, however, the empires and continents tried to use religion as an ideology to start a war, there will be no hope for normal people in a diversity of country which held same belief.</p>
<p>Therefore, the painting ironically demonstrates that as long as dominators or dynasties no longer utilizes religion as a tool to control the public, that is the time when light will back to life.</p>
<p>Step 1: I tried to sketch the outline of my drawing. I used several types of pencil. At first, the lines are too dim for me to see, and I worried about that I cannot see my lines clearly when painting.<br>obviously,the lines are more clear now,but it’s harder for me to cover these lines or erase them. moreover, the pencil lines may mixed with the colors.Hence I use 4B to make it darker again. painted the first layer of colour without any shadow, but I mixed white colour with black paint so that the clouds becomes a bit darker.</p>

            <p>Holding the literature club and offered a lecture for juniors about the Japanese literature history as well as several authors in statue.</p>
<p>During yesterday service we offered lectures on Japanese literature history to our juniors in the afternoon, an academic atmosphere was formed by the high-freedom discussions of a variable of topics between the holders and participants. We had a mainstream of what we should teach throughout the history, involving a diversity of periods, and what was each period’s representative authors so did analyzing their own styles. </p>
<p>Examples were presented in order to explain things in detail so that juniors can have a better understanding of these abstract concepts. I cooperated with my desk-mate Violet to make the presentation together. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/BmIGKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/25/BmIGKU.jpg" alt="BmIGKU.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Moreover, I provided several questions in relation to the topic for guiding a depth thinking of juniors, for instance, why both naturalism occurred in both Japan and France most popularly, and which kinds of culture could foster such style in literature?</p>
<p>If both Japan and France blossomed such style, what’s their similarity and differences in culture? After the club meeting, we found some essays online and prepared to answer them in the next activity. We also provided chances for juniors to make their own questions as well, for instance, if they got any interests in the background of Japanese culture, they might question about how delicate it was of Japanese poetry compared with those of Chinese and EA, including the usage of variable symbols.</p>

            <p>I select running my Literature Club as not only my CAS project but also my main out-school activity. I posited the club manager and my job is to organize where we hold each meeting every time as well as the content we discuss. Moreover, I set tasks on each occupation for my club members, so that they can finish their work in time. </p>
<p>Literature club is not just for entertainment after school, but also a place for everyone to have more or less progress on member’s language study in school, for everyone to freely express their ideas on a diversity of books, or even political affairs. Our aim is to provide somewhere students are able to share their thoughts without being criticized. Moreover, since I handed in the application form to school for a start investment, we have $900 to purchase books for members, of course, all of the magazines, books, readings are belong to Club.</p>
<p>Usually, I organize literature meeting once a week. We have different topics every time, based on the principle of democracy, before the talk there will be a vote in group chat for members to choose their favorite topic. We offer the selections in a variety of fields, including Ancient Chinese poets, Latin-America Literature, Europe and America history, Japanese culture, etc. Despite these, we emphasize on different methods on writing as well, for instance, a research on Stream of Conscious help us better understand why Virginia Woolf’s work impress on us that much, and why she could capture the echos brilliantly where a society lunch is apparently magicked into existence. </p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/0j8Rrq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/18/0j8Rrq.jpg" alt="0j8Rrq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Moreover, my club had an official account on WeChat to show our articles after activities. There are some articles which written by myself. All of the members have the capacity and chance to contribute their own passages. Good poets as well as literature pieces of work are placed on our account.</p>
<p>Story of us ain’t over, and everyone takes the charge of continuing our dream on literature.</p>

            <p>The second week started with a sunny day. The mock trial tournament had been over for a month, but we still need to prepare for it, for the lecture we gave to our freshmen. I found that teaching is actually harder than corresponding something by myself. When seeing the confusing faces of my juniors, I felt kinda funny because one year ago, I was also a confused girl who tried my best to understand what my seniors said. We made a presentation to show the whole procedure of Mock Trial, shared some knowledge about law as well. </p>
<p>We introduce how to proceed a Mock Trial. </p>
<p>Procedure: Pre-trial matters by both sides</p>
<p>Opening statement by both sides</p>
<p>Direction examination by plaintiff (first witness)</p>
<p>Cross Examination by defense counsel</p>
<p>DX by plaintiff (2nd witness)</p>
<p>CX by defense</p>
<p>DX by plaintiff(3rd witness)</p>
<p>CX by defense</p>
<p>DX by defense，CX by plaintiff（etc）</p>
<p>Closing arguments by both sides</p>
<p>Rebuttle by the plaintiff</p>
<p>Court over.</p>
<p>Actually, the steps in mock trial is much less complicated than the real court, without jury and court clerk. Under the unwritten law system, I felt there are lots of flaws need to be fixed in written law system. Although rational rules make some restrictions in our life, humans’ emotional and moods cannot be simply defined as right or wrong. For instance, a girl murdered someone who killed her dad for revenge when law cannot hold the justice for her, can we simply said that the girl was a murderer? Moral has two sides, and things are much confusing in reality even compared with science fictions. From my perspective, jury can be overwhelmed by the emotion and ignore the truth sometimes when judge a case, how can we be fair when only invoking the law terms which be written by officers sit in an office?</p>

            <p> I have been busy about the election in Student Union this week, since i didn’t take part in the Student Union election in the first year of starting school, I want to have a try this year, and it’s easier for a Grade 11 student to gain votes among classmates as well as the freshmen. I select the position of discipline and order department. </p>
<p>There are more things need to do than i expected, not to mention that the speeches and presentation i have to make in each class or in front of the whole school, much more art works have to be down by ourselves. I have spent a whole summer to learn drawing on my I-pad by myself, and finally, i can apply the skill to my daily life. I took the responsibility of painting the poster for my team， so does the speeches and advertising as well; while my partner decided to do the presentation which will be posted on the screen of our school broadcasting station.</p>
<p>I haven’t done the speech yet, since I spent a whole day to draw the poster, i didn’t have much energy to complete another task!</p>
<p>Here is my poster, my partner Jack and I. </p>

            <p>The school has been started for a week and I finally attended the course which I selected last semester. Liberal arts contain such much fun, but reading becomes the main and most essential part as well. Despite the class time and class work I had through the week, on the sunny afternoon on a chair, with bottom of milk tea I would love to have, art has never been such critical combination of my spare time. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/06/wmkDmR.jpg" alt="wmkDmR.jpg"></p>
<p>My family always have a bias that doing art needs not much intelligence, and art can be only considered as an entertainment instead of a real work. To be honest, visual art really takes me a lot of time. And finally, I can have a whole afternoon enjoy impressionism in silent. </p>
<p>Breaking free of the naturalism of Impressionism in the late 1880s, a group of young painters sought independent artistic styles for expressing emotions rather than simply optical impressions, concentrating on themes of deeper symbolism. </p>
<p>Georges Seurat was at the forefront of the challenges to Impressionism with his unique analyses based on then-current notions of optical and color theories. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/06/wmkhXd.jpg" alt="wmkhXd.jpg"></p>
<p>In 19th century, the impressionism was attacked by the classical artists, which be considered as a ridiculous style of painting, and impressionisms failed to exhibit their paintings through the official  exhibitions. As the pioneer artists of impressionism with specific opinions in the match of colour based on main colour stream, like red, yellow, orange, originally, without any ingredients, to mix and create a vivid dream. </p>
<p>The representative, Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) exhibited in 1874, gave the Impressionist movement its name when the critic Louis Leroy accused it of being a sketch or “impression,” not a finished painting. Although this style of art received a lot of crisis, it actually impressed the later genres and the whole Europe.</p>

<p>In addition, I thought literature can share some links with the impressionism as well. Using colours and brushes, artists have the capacity to build a world of imagination, and we prescribe the vivld image can also be created based on words. To be more specific, One Hundred Years of Solitude, impressed me with a complete generation of Latin America, based on such way of describing domestic affairs through one’s mental status, flow of mind, and ever-lasting changes of colours in the surroundings constructed by solitude human beings.</p>
