            <p>The dry flowers which represent the end of life in a deadly beauty, that is, even if these flowers withered after blossomed, they still remain a sense of elegant for people to cherish. I considered that these dried flowers in relation to death, and I made two of them into a cross section in front of the sunflower.<br>The cross-section I made in relation to religious means, that is to say, the cross actually metaphor the crucifixion which locked the sunflower. If the sunflower is prevented to produce sunlight, then there would be no lights for the world, and that is the reason why could behind are darker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DG1Xy8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/22/DG1Xy8.jpg" alt="DG1Xy8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>However, what I want to say is not that the religion doesn’t exist lights, by contrast, just the belief gives us life meanings and hope, however, the empires and continents tried to use religion as an ideology to start a war, there will be no hope for normal people in a diversity of country which held same belief.</p>
<p>Therefore, the painting ironically demonstrates that as long as dominators or dynasties no longer utilizes religion as a tool to control the public, that is the time when light will back to life.</p>
<p>Step 1: I tried to sketch the outline of my drawing. I used several types of pencil. At first, the lines are too dim for me to see, and I worried about that I cannot see my lines clearly when painting.<br>obviously,the lines are more clear now,but it’s harder for me to cover these lines or erase them. moreover, the pencil lines may mixed with the colors.Hence I use 4B to make it darker again. painted the first layer of colour without any shadow, but I mixed white colour with black paint so that the clouds becomes a bit darker.</p>

            <p>Holding the literature club and offered a lecture for juniors about the Japanese literature history as well as several authors in statue.</p>
<p>During yesterday service we offered lectures on Japanese literature history to our juniors in the afternoon, an academic atmosphere was formed by the high-freedom discussions of a variable of topics between the holders and participants. We had a mainstream of what we should teach throughout the history, involving a diversity of periods, and what was each period’s representative authors so did analyzing their own styles. </p>
<p>Examples were presented in order to explain things in detail so that juniors can have a better understanding of these abstract concepts. I cooperated with my desk-mate Violet to make the presentation together. </p>

<p>Moreover, I provided several questions in relation to the topic for guiding a depth thinking of juniors, for instance, why both naturalism occurred in both Japan and France most popularly, and which kinds of culture could foster such style in literature?</p>
<p>If both Japan and France blossomed such style, what’s their similarity and differences in culture? After the club meeting, we found some essays online and prepared to answer them in the next activity. We also provided chances for juniors to make their own questions as well, for instance, if they got any interests in the background of Japanese culture, they might question about how delicate it was of Japanese poetry compared with those of Chinese and EA, including the usage of variable symbols.</p>

            <p>I select running my Literature Club as not only my CAS project but also my main out-school activity. I posited the club manager and my job is to organize where we hold each meeting every time as well as the content we discuss. Moreover, I set tasks on each occupation for my club members, so that they can finish their work in time. </p>
<p>Literature club is not just for entertainment after school, but also a place for everyone to have more or less progress on member’s language study in school, for everyone to freely express their ideas on a diversity of books, or even political affairs. Our aim is to provide somewhere students are able to share their thoughts without being criticized. Moreover, since I handed in the application form to school for a start investment, we have $900 to purchase books for members, of course, all of the magazines, books, readings are belong to Club.</p>
<p>Usually, I organize literature meeting once a week. We have different topics every time, based on the principle of democracy, before the talk there will be a vote in group chat for members to choose their favorite topic. We offer the selections in a variety of fields, including Ancient Chinese poets, Latin-America Literature, Europe and America history, Japanese culture, etc. Despite these, we emphasize on different methods on writing as well, for instance, a research on Stream of Conscious help us better understand why Virginia Woolf’s work impress on us that much, and why she could capture the echos brilliantly where a society lunch is apparently magicked into existence. </p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/0j8Rrq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/18/0j8Rrq.jpg" alt="0j8Rrq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Moreover, my club had an official account on WeChat to show our articles after activities. There are some articles which written by myself. All of the members have the capacity and chance to contribute their own passages. Good poets as well as literature pieces of work are placed on our account.</p>
<p>Story of us ain’t over, and everyone takes the charge of continuing our dream on literature.</p>

            <p>The second week started with a sunny day. The mock trial tournament had been over for a month, but we still need to prepare for it, for the lecture we gave to our freshmen. I found that teaching is actually harder than corresponding something by myself. When seeing the confusing faces of my juniors, I felt kinda funny because one year ago, I was also a confused girl who tried my best to understand what my seniors said. We made a presentation to show the whole procedure of Mock Trial, shared some knowledge about law as well. </p>
<p>We introduce how to proceed a Mock Trial. </p>
<p>Procedure: Pre-trial matters by both sides</p>
<p>Opening statement by both sides</p>
<p>Direction examination by plaintiff (first witness)</p>
<p>Cross Examination by defense counsel</p>
<p>DX by plaintiff (2nd witness)</p>
<p>CX by defense</p>
<p>DX by plaintiff(3rd witness)</p>
<p>CX by defense</p>
<p>DX by defense，CX by plaintiff（etc）</p>
<p>Closing arguments by both sides</p>
<p>Rebuttle by the plaintiff</p>
<p>Court over.</p>
<p>Actually, the steps in mock trial is much less complicated than the real court, without jury and court clerk. Under the unwritten law system, I felt there are lots of flaws need to be fixed in written law system. Although rational rules make some restrictions in our life, humans’ emotional and moods cannot be simply defined as right or wrong. For instance, a girl murdered someone who killed her dad for revenge when law cannot hold the justice for her, can we simply said that the girl was a murderer? Moral has two sides, and things are much confusing in reality even compared with science fictions. From my perspective, jury can be overwhelmed by the emotion and ignore the truth sometimes when judge a case, how can we be fair when only invoking the law terms which be written by officers sit in an office?</p>

            <p> I have been busy about the election in Student Union this week, since i didn’t take part in the Student Union election in the first year of starting school, I want to have a try this year, and it’s easier for a Grade 11 student to gain votes among classmates as well as the freshmen. I select the position of discipline and order department. </p>
<p>There are more things need to do than i expected, not to mention that the speeches and presentation i have to make in each class or in front of the whole school, much more art works have to be down by ourselves. I have spent a whole summer to learn drawing on my I-pad by myself, and finally, i can apply the skill to my daily life. I took the responsibility of painting the poster for my team， so does the speeches and advertising as well; while my partner decided to do the presentation which will be posted on the screen of our school broadcasting station.</p>
<p>I haven’t done the speech yet, since I spent a whole day to draw the poster, i didn’t have much energy to complete another task!</p>
<p>Here is my poster, my partner Jack and I. </p>

            <p>The school has been started for a week and I finally attended the course which I selected last semester. Liberal arts contain such much fun, but reading becomes the main and most essential part as well. Despite the class time and class work I had through the week, on the sunny afternoon on a chair, with bottom of milk tea I would love to have, art has never been such critical combination of my spare time. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/06/wmkDmR.jpg" alt="wmkDmR.jpg"></p>
<p>My family always have a bias that doing art needs not much intelligence, and art can be only considered as an entertainment instead of a real work. To be honest, visual art really takes me a lot of time. And finally, I can have a whole afternoon enjoy impressionism in silent. </p>
<p>Breaking free of the naturalism of Impressionism in the late 1880s, a group of young painters sought independent artistic styles for expressing emotions rather than simply optical impressions, concentrating on themes of deeper symbolism. </p>
<p>Georges Seurat was at the forefront of the challenges to Impressionism with his unique analyses based on then-current notions of optical and color theories. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/06/wmkhXd.jpg" alt="wmkhXd.jpg"></p>
<p>In 19th century, the impressionism was attacked by the classical artists, which be considered as a ridiculous style of painting, and impressionisms failed to exhibit their paintings through the official  exhibitions. As the pioneer artists of impressionism with specific opinions in the match of colour based on main colour stream, like red, yellow, orange, originally, without any ingredients, to mix and create a vivid dream. </p>
<p>The representative, Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) exhibited in 1874, gave the Impressionist movement its name when the critic Louis Leroy accused it of being a sketch or “impression,” not a finished painting. Although this style of art received a lot of crisis, it actually impressed the later genres and the whole Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/wmkXcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/06/wmkXcQ.jpg" alt="wmkXcQ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In addition, I thought literature can share some links with the impressionism as well. Using colours and brushes, artists have the capacity to build a world of imagination, and we prescribe the vivld image can also be created based on words. To be more specific, One Hundred Years of Solitude, impressed me with a complete generation of Latin America, based on such way of describing domestic affairs through one’s mental status, flow of mind, and ever-lasting changes of colours in the surroundings constructed by solitude human beings.</p>

            <p>Background: the Athenian general Pericles tried to consolidate his power by using public money, the dues paid to Athens by its allies. He believed that spent money on temples and arts could gain him the popularity from the public, as well as the prestige of Athens’ and his. And indeed. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/30/dbs9US.jpg" alt="dbs9US.jpg"></p>
<p>Architecture of classic Greek Parthenon, known as the most noteworthy result of Pericles’ public works campaign, was a temple in honor of the city’s patron goddess Athena. The temple was built atop the Acropolis, a nature pedestal made of rock. For usual temples, they were often painted in bright colors and were arrayed on a solid blue or red background. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/dbsiCQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/30/dbsiCQ.jpg" alt="dbsiCQ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>For proportion and Perspective, the architects of classical Greece came up with many sophisticated techniques to make their buildings look even prefect. They crafted horizontal planes with a very slight upward U-shape and columns that were fatter in the middle than at the ends. Without these innovations, the buildings would appear to sag; with them, they looked flawless and majestic. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/30/dbskgs.jpg" alt="dbskgs.jpg"></p>
<p>Not many classical statues or sculptures survive today. Stone statues broke easily, and metal ones were often melted for re-use. However, we know that Greek sculptors such as Phidias and Polykleitos in the 5th century and Praxiteles,  Skopas and Lysippos in the 4th century had figured out how to apply the rules of anatomy and perspective to the human form just as their counterparts applied them to buildings. Earlier statues of people had looked awkward and fake, but by the classical period they looked natural, almost at ease. They even had realistic-looking facial expressions.</p>

            <p>I have been participating in art courses from this summer. Actually, i am not pretty good at art, since I have seldom practice before, but I still held this interest from primary school till now. There are many kinds of art in art history which I have never learnt before. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/29/d7dI2V.jpg" alt="d7dI2V.jpg"></p>
<p>To be honest, this is the first time I have ever contacted with so much sorts of art from ancient Egypt to the modern society. Generally, Surrealism attracts me the most through its imagination. I will introduce several kinds of art today. Firstly, we can know that human beings have a sense of Beauty from the pre-historic time. Although the painting they drew on the stone may be used to record something, however, these paintings are valuable resource for us to learn their life.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/29/d7dOa9.jpg" alt="d7dOa9.jpg"></p>
<p> A swath of Europe include over 200 caves with spectacular Aurignacian paintings, drawings and sculpture. The Caves: the caves at Chauvet-Pont-Arc, Lascaux, Pech Merle, and Altamira contain the best known examples of pre-historic painting and drawing, are more than 30000 years old. While Lascaux and Altamira are more recent, 15000B.C.E approximately. Neolithic Revolution A settled life- Stonehenge, an example. Neolithic sculpture became bigger, pottery became more widespread and was used to store food harvested from farms. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/29/d7dz26.jpg" alt="d7dz26.jpg"></p>
<p>This is when alcohol first produced and when interior and exterior decoration, first appears. Stonehenge is about 320 feet in circumference and the stones which compose the outer ring weigh as much as 50 tons. The design must have been carried out by a culture. Plastered Skulls We first find good evidence for religious practice, a perpetual inspiration in fine arts. The traditional interpretation of these the skulls has been that they offered a means of preserving and worshiping male ancestors. But recent research shows that a large number of these skulls come from women or kids. Moreover, Neolithic people did not have written language. We cannot predict precisely when their culture begin. </p>
<p>Here I manage to mimic the style of pre-historic art, two people were chasing after the deers. They could use some simple tools at that time,</p>

            <p>After 2 days of my PeerPotential Mock Trial tournament, i got really tired up and wanna a good rest. Although my team was not as component as the last team I lead, i still learn a lot of things. Leading a team was hard, especially when your teammates had their own thought, and thought themselves correct.</p>

<p> I have emphasized on the character evidence several times, and finally they listened to my advice. We had arguments on different opinions indeed, but that didn’t mean we sucked. Me myself like a tutor for them to guide all the skills in tournament, and they also taught me how to be patient and held a peaceful mind. This is the first time I have ever wrote a closing argument by myself. </p>
<p>I would like to do it because there is a procedure called rebuttals after the CA from plaintiff, and i definitely love that. You can never write or prepared your rebuttals before the tournament, for it requires you to attack defense’s idea, and you have no idea to know what is your opponent idea until you are there. I made a lot of notes, corrected some points, deleted useless words as well. And here the following is my Closing Argument. </p>

<p>May it please the court, the opposing counsel, member of the jury.</p>
<p> To offset one mistake, larger mistake was made. Having a happy family is a basic wish for every women. However, just before the 20th anniversary of a happy successful couple, the Bennetts, suffered from apart of the passing away of our Hollywood director, Jacob Bennett. We held firm belief that Bennett would be blessed by god and conduct justice without losing his life in his sunset. But the reality is cruel. Their partner, Jackie Owens, seek for a chance to pay back his debts, and for a chance to get more money, a gun was lost, a body was found six feet under. To offered his debt, he needed to get Jacob out of his way. But a happy family could never asked Jacob to return. Jacob cannot just die under the evil plot of a gambler who burden heavy debts. Your honour, today we prosecution hope the court find Jackie Owens was eligible for the first degree murder, the most serious penalty in the world, in order to return Jacob Bennett the Justice he deserves. As prosecution, we do bear burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Jackie Owens was eligible for the first degree of murder. But this does not mean any doubt and as long as the four legal components for first degree murder are met, Jackie should be found guilty.</p>
<p> To begin with, Owens made a plan to murder Bennett. He thought his plan was perfect, a brilliant idea, utilising Casey’s motive and instigating his emotion against Jacob, then pushes all the responsibility to Casey Maxwell. It seems that Casey had larger motivation to kill, since he had some arguments between the victim and poorer than Jackie. However, we cannot let our moods to overwhelm our reason, Jackie Owens, who manipulated the whole murder. Indeed he doesn’t own a gun, but he asked Casey Maxwell to lend him one, the Beretta, which haven’t been found till now. Owens kept pushing him, harder and harder, sizing Casey up and required him to follow Owens’s rule. Moreover, he even analysed what’s the good of making Jacob disappear, of course by the method of cajoling as well as threatening. Text messages have to be delated, evidence has to be cleared, and if Owens himself was in other country, even better. However, as Owens said, he prepared for the anniversary for Jacob, but why, after Jacob missing on that morning, he did not even show a concern of his whereabouts and left to London? Fortunately, our detective Finch got Owens at once when Owens back to Midlands, and Mr.Finch will help us to find out the  truth.</p>
<p> Ari Finch，as a detective who had a lot of experience, help us with today’s case. After Bennett was missing, he boarded The Hepburn, a boat which belongs to Casey Maxwell, to collect some evidence we need. An overpowering smell of bleach. Form our expert, Jordan Lee, claimed that the bleach was perfect for destroy the evidence of DNA. Some may argue that bleach can be used to clean the dirt, however, how can a normal dose of bleach can make the detective felt intolerable? Luckily, we still find useable clues on the dock. A blood stain. The stain belongs to Jacob. They also found the fingerprint of Jackie on the boat. In addition, detective Finch provided us with some other essential clues. Although the method Finch utilised was a bit tough, we had to admit he indeed ask out for something. When facing the accusation of Finch, Owens didn’t deny he is the murderer, instead, he yelled at Finch, saying, you will never prove it. using the same method on Maxwell, Maxwell finally tell us everything about him between Owens. Owens required Maxwell to delete all the records on phones, but we still got a permission of judge to find the record which saved in Phone Company. Form the record, we found that two texts exchanged between Owens and Maxwell, and two more they exchanged on the morning of the murder. </p>
<p>Despite this, Owens forced his friend, Alex Grace to help him act, Grace said everything to confirm what Jackie said. Still, we can find more evidence form the expert, Doctor Lee.</p>
<p> Doctor Lee noticed the mud on Owens’s car, and he took the mud to analyze. However, there is no dirt, fibers, or even hairs on the car. The trunk smells like a bleach as well. There is no bleach in Owens estate, if he really wants to tidy up his car, how can he does not store bleach in his house? The mud which we found on Owens’s car lead to the place where we found Jacob’s body. Calcium carbonate contained in the mud, but as we know, this chemical element doesn’t usually appear in Midlands. Calkins Cliff, where we found Bennett’s body, contains a huge amount of calcium carbonate. We also had some findings of Owens’s Maserati. According to Hunter, which quoting from Doctor’s Lee, the color of the light of the car which appeared on the night of murder was purple xenon light. It’s pity that we found Owens’s car was not purple, instead, it’s yellow. But that doesn’t mean he is innocent, because we had found the scratches and unprofessional trace, which indicates that someone have changed the light. </p>
<p>The defendant argues that Owens can’t be at the crime scene during that period because he was attending Grace’s house But that claim is insufficient to prove his absence. First of all, the content which they told the police is not the same, as Owens testimony claimed that, they did not talk anything about work, but Grace said they had. Even if they are together that night, Alex Grace was an actor, lying is easy for him and what he said is not reliable. Moreover, due to Finch’s affidavit, there is proof of Jackie persuaded Grace to act for him. So in the end, we prosecution had successfully fulfilled the four components for first degree murder and completed the burden of prove. </p>

<p>YH, Owens needed to offset one mistake, but he made a larger one, deprived the sunset of Jacob and the husband of a family. And will you just let him continue desecrating justice? Your verdict is important and will benefit the society by making stern warning to drug dealing companies and deterring future grievances. Please find Jackie  Owens liable for 1st degree murder</p>

            <p>Preparing for the tournament is also one of the most exciting things. During these days, I have finished my direct examinations as well as cross examinations. Well, my team is not so strong as the last one, since my partners fail to have time to take part in. I have to burden the position of being the team leader, aid my teammates with their DX and CX. Many objections can be made, and what I need to do is impacting on them how to avoid these objections. All in all, enable the judge to follow our thoughts and making opposing counsels fail to object are my ultimate goals. It’s tiring to lead a team form of freshmen, however, if we achieve success, i will be happier.</p>
<p> Rule of evidence is one of the most essential documents we have now. Sometimes i know that a few evidences can be objected even if they are important, rule of evidence can be the most powerful weapon when we debate with opposing counsels. with my latest DX following. </p>
<p>CZR DX Alex Grace A:Good morning, Miss Grace. W: Good morning.</p>
<p> A: Could you spell your name for the court? W: Sure. I’m Alex Grace. A l e x g r a c e. </p>
<p>A:Could you please introduce yourself briefly?</p>
<p> W: yes. I am a good actor, and made my career and my fortune by starring in Hollywood blockbusters. I got to know Jackie through my career.</p>
<p> A: As you mentioned Jackie, could you briefly introduce your relationship with him?</p>
<p> W: We are really good friends since he gave me big break in Hollywood. I had been doing big roles on Broadway but he gave me the chance to be on sliver screen! A: So let’s move to today’s case.</p>
<p> A: What did you do on June 17, 2019? </p>
<p>W: I had dinner with Jackie on that day. That was the first time we did not dine out,but it was great. I cooked by myself. </p>
<p>A: So when did Jackie arrive? </p>
<p>W: About 8:00pm.</p>
<p> A: what did you do with Jackie that night?</p>
<p> W: Jackie brought two bottles of wine which I never tried before. Jackie was in great mood, we talked a lot about all sorts of topics. </p>
<p>A: Do you remember what Jackie talked about?</p>
<p> W: Yeah…He talked about how enjoyable working with Jacob, and expressing his concern about their partner, Casey.</p>
<p> A: What’s Jackie’s concern? </p>
<p>W: He said Casey had been acting strangely and complaining about Jacob behind his back.</p>
<p> A: And when did Jackie left?</p>
<p> W: About 1 a.m., he drove his Maserati home.</p>
<p>A: OK, let’s talk about something about Casey now. </p>
<p>A: Could you please tell us more about what Casey complain about Jacob?</p>
<p> W: He said that Jacob mistreated him. The more Casey drank, the louder he got. Well, they been trapped in arguments, and Jacob laugh at Casey. That’s the last time I seen them together. </p>
<p>A: So what is the relationship of Jackie and Jacob?</p>
<p> W: They always get along well with each other. </p>
<p>A: Let’s date back to July 3, when you at the police office.</p>
<p> A: Have you ever been to Casey’s boat? </p>
<p>W: Yes…Jackie had been on Casey’s boat and I’d with him all the time! </p>
<p>A: So why did you go with him? </p>
<p>W: Well, It’s about business. Jackie came up the with the idea that Casey should cast me in Casey’s next movie. It was Sunday, so we thought that Casey would at on his boat. </p>
<p>A: And did you succeed in working with the business?</p>
<p> W: Nope. Casey wasn’t there, though. We cannot find him anywhere.</p>
<p> A: what’s your next move when seeing Casey not there?</p>
<p> W: so we left. We left without seeing Casey or anyone else there. I yelled at him to stop dawdling on the boat and lift me home. </p>
<p>No further questions, YH.</p>
