            <p>This is what I made for my critical thinking. We often view news in our daily life, but do these news fair enough? The answer is no. Therefore, I tried to read some sources by myself and analyzed them. I had my own bias as well, which I think is inevitable, but at least Iattempted to solve my bias towards media. Also, I would like to see others’ opinions of why the media may not biased, and to see if those views can presuade me. through this process, my logical skill would improve and consider things more fairly.</p>

            <p>May it please the court, the opposing counsel, members of the jury.</p>
<p>Honestly Speaking, the defense also believes the kidnap left the victim with trauma mentally and physically. Nobody in this courtroom ever doubted the severity of this tragedy. However, facing such calamity, our emotions may overwhelm our reason. The defendant will not let that happen. Our job is to figure out the facts and follow the law instruction. Sinclair, a charitarian who donated $40000 to the school science lab generously, helped several kids who suffered from family pressure and childhood shadow, how could he kidnap a kid, Kiran, who shared the same experience with him? Although according to the truth and the law, Sinclair didn’t commit the crime of kidnapping, this ridiculous accuse will ruin this young student’s reputation, development, and future. We had seen the tragedy of Kiran, and we don’t want another tragedy to come to his innocent friend. He had donated his finance and energy to society, and this time his effort should return on him.</p>
<p>Today, we the defense bear no burden of proof and didn’t have to prove anything. The prosecution bears the burden. As they have charged Sinclair with the crime, they must bear the burden in the criminal justice system. They must prove their case beyond any reasonable doubt. They not only must prove that Sinclair kidnapped Kiran T, but that Sinclair intended to kidnap him. And also all the preparation such as email sending and drug dealing was made just by Sinclair himself.</p>
<p>The first reasonable doubt raised by us is that Jaden Sinclair was at the concert.</p>
<p>Our witness, Jaden Sinclair, had provided a firm alibi that at the night of the kidnap, he was in his room watching TV since the leader of the party had come for him to tell all the kids to go back home.<br>State back to the evidence, the victim was found inside Sinclair’s truck, but he even did not have the car keys around him, and the keys are not found till now. We can make a reasonable hypothesis: someone stole Sinclair’s car and kidnap Kiran. Moreover, it’s very ridiculous for Sinclair to send blackmail to Kiran. Firstly, Sinclair can’t send such mail since he didn’t even have the address of Kiran’s mail. Secondly, there’s no motivation for him to ask for 250000$ from Kiran. Sinclair owns independent economic capacity, he even refused $1500 from Kiran to pay for the party cars. Thirdly, the modus operandi was rather immature because it’s very easy to find Kiran in the trunk and does no real harm to him. </p>
<p>Our victim, Kiran, who experienced the whole process, has claimed that the person who kidnapped him was not Sinclair. He has proved that Sinclair was the one who saved him, not the one who hurt him. Also, Kiran mentioned that Sinclair and he communicated on the phone instead of by email. On the night of the party, Kiran indeed got a little drunk, but he is an adult now and it’s able for him to drink some wine. In addition, he received the retreated money from Sinclair, which confirmed that Sinclair did not intend to get money from kids.</p>
<p>From the telling of Sinclair and Kiran, we’ve shown the firm alibi and lack of motivation on the night of the kidnap.</p>
<p>We would like to further doubt the testimony of Cleo Taufique and Shae Reynolds.</p>
<p>Initially, from what Kiran’s parent, Cleo Taufique had testified, she pushed her son very hard at his young age. She ignored a teenager’s normal social demands and gave him pressure. Therefore, just before the year that Kiran will go to university, he showed signs of being anxiety and phobia. She even threw his book into the trash without talking to him, how can she expected Kiran to communicate with her? Just because of the failure of such communication as a parent should do to her child, Cleo Taufique failed to understand her son. (临场补充）</p>
<p>Moreover, the witness from the prosecution, Shae Reynolds, didn’t provide enough evidence to arrest Sinclair in jail. Although Kiran was found in the trunk, the remote control was missing and still missing till now. The ransom note was sent by an anonymous address that was just created, and the PDA itself was fraudulent and there was no evidence to identify its register. Although Kiran ingested in GHB and may lose his memory,  there’s no evidence to prove that it was Sinclair who put the GHB into his glass. Although Sinclair’s funds had been dwindling rapidly, he had a house with 4000 square feet with a detached three-car garage. (临场补充）There is no firm evidence to prove that Sinclair kidnapped Kiran, and intend to do so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we defendant would like to raise another doubt of imputation from 3 perspectives.<br>As Detective Reynolds mentioned, the organization was seemed to be a cult due to the members shave their heads and wear white cloth, but this was not Sinclair’s idea. Secondly, on the night of the prom, everyone was in Sinclair’s house, so anyone could put GHB in his room secretly or stole his car key. Thirdly, the ransom note’s email address was just created, which can be made by anyone who familiar with Sinclair and Kiran. Sinclair had proved all the members’ names to the detective, but she ignored and did not record them down due to her personal bias and experience. All of the members believed Sinclair would not harm Kiran, even the victim himself. To say the least, Jaden Sinclair had owned an organization in which everyone trusts each other, why he broke it and using such a ridiculous conspiracy? Does it make sense? The defense may reasonably doubt that the whole process was only a clumsy imputation made by who wants to make trouble to Sinclair and harm Kiran.</p>
<p>Your Honor, we want to emphasize that the prosecutor needs to solve all 3 reasonable doubts raised by us. The prosecutor failed your honor, Sinclair was simply an innocent donator who wants to return to society. As Kiran has been harmed so much by mental pressure from his parent and such an event, why would we harm him again? For Sinclair, he still needs to keep his investigation wor. He would use his money and foundation to help more people that suffered. However, this innocent<br>university student was facing a ridiculous felony charge today. He had donated his finance and energy to society, and this time his effort should return on him. Your honor, please save Sinclair’s<br>reputation and future. Please find Skyler Sinclair not guilty of the crime of kidnapping.</p>

            <p>In school, I selected English as my extended essay subject, and my research question was, to what extent does the American film industry affected public attitudes towards suspected terrorists. However, in the very beginning, my topic was is torture ever justified. I have read the international laws concerning torture, and it is banned by most of the country. But I started to think,  torture, defined as pain, suffering, using an interrogation device, led to a continuum and the 2 extremes are on one hand torturing somebody to death; or non-lethal torture leaves on mental scars, causing unbearable pain but not long damage. I wondered if it’s real that the intention of international law to prohibit torture only out of the moral and ethical ground, or out of other reasons? Maybe it sounds like a conspiracy theory; however, the real purpose underneath the prohibition can be politically correct. Since in nowadays society, people merely have the right to be extreme or hate something. Thoughts and emotions can be rather private, but you just cannot speak out loud you support some actions or ideology which against the mainstream. Philosophers who supported banned torture hold the opinion that using torture techniques made no difference with terrorists, while the against ideas provide an occasion which states the efficiency of using torture when innocents are facing the threat from the terrorist. They give out an extreme example of a terrorist bombing an airplane, but from a statistics perspective, the probability for such an event to happen is tiny. However, those who supported torture offer us several benefits of torture in an emergency. Firstly, gathering the information quickly. Second, it’s fast and effective. From the first sight you may think those advantages are reasonable, but think it carefully, how can you examine the truthfulness of what the person says under extreme situations? He/she may lie and says what you want to hear. But as you can see all of the above statements are hypothesis, we have to use evidences to support these ideas. And I will write about the topic deeper next week.</p>

            <p>An analyze of last century jewelries related to women’s position<br>My comparative study based on the research of a diversity of jewelries designs in different era on women’s clothing. Thousands of years ago human have raised the concept of beauty, and from then on the ornaments has developed due to human’s improving aesthetic, especially in dresssing code.I have chosen three artwork from different eras to analyze, which are Portrait of Lady Mary Villiers as Saint Agnes by Sir Anthony van Duck, Francois Boucher, Mademe de Pompadour in 1759, and </p>
<p>Sir Anthony van Duck, a Belgium artist who borns in 1599, was the seventh child of a wealthy silk merchant family. When he was young, he learnt from a cabinet painter and began to paint. After graduating from the Saint Luke’s Guild in 1618, he was already in demand as a portrait painter. He succeeded in religious and mythological pictures in Italy and his representative painting was Charles I.</p>
<p> The portrait of Lady Mary Villiers as Saint Agnes was maybe painted on the eve of her marriage in 1637, when Duck was 38 years old. The lady rested in a rocky cave and holding a Pam branch, looks quietly and in sorrow. Her dress is fashionable, as we can see the style of Baroque designing. the style of Baroque was seen as nobly, defined as curving silhouettte, flowing lines and gold filigree as well as righ colours. In the portrait we can see light blue colour and grey silk(ribbons), contained abundance of<br> jewelries, overall voluptuousness. the whole theme in the clothing design tended to be dark, but gave an elegant impression.</p>
<p>As we known the women’s right began to rise on the 20th century due to an increasing rate of employments in the factory, since men went on to the front line and the army was in urgent need of food storage and products, women had to work for them. However, we can deduce that from the 17th century, women’s right started to proceed becasue of that’s when they have capacity to choose a variety of different dressing by themselves instead of fulfill men’s aesthetic.</p>

            <p>Recently i have read some passages which related to the topic of whether the mainstream media is liberally biased nowadays. The points of view in the passage are rather interesting, where both sides have given out their own opinions and using evidences to prove their ideas. Since I am an Asian and will go to Europe or American to study in the future, I am interested in the different cultural groups which in the anglophone countries. I used to heard about some gossips about how Asians are badly treated in the circle, and that’s remind me of how black people faced discrimination in the last century, but the situation seems to be better now…is that true? Although we can see a lot of colleges lower their standards to black people, is it really shows the respect? There are many questions can be discovered from the issue, and the issue is globally. I won’t talk about this topic in detail in this passage but in the future i will.</p>
<p>The reason why i think about the question actually comes from a tiny affair of the art festival in our school. I am participating into it as an vocal who sing rap songs. However, my parents seem to dislike rap culture. I have been practiced the songs for about whole week. To be honest, I did not like rap culture before, but this song changed my mind. Rap is very hard to sing because there is a lot of  rhythm in it and the whole speed is very fast. I have done some research before of the new culture, the data around me shows that the last generation more likely to refuse sub culture than the new generation. Also, most of the people seems to have a bias on the rap because the origin was from the black people in the slum and the lyrics were simple and dirty, hence they hold an unappreciated mind towards it. However,  nowadays there are an amount of rap singers who are white people and you can see, yellow group. I would say that rap is a form of expressing the ideas and feelings rather than a certain sub culture, because everyone can just simply write their personal stories and speak it out loudly with rhyme.</p>

            <p>My name is Lorena. I am a high-school visual artist and a trial competitor who is passionate about law. I am easy-going since, in my opinion, its of paramount importance to establish good relationships between friends and clients. I always respect everyone around me because I think different ideas can help me improve in a variety of ways. Listening to a range of people is especially important for me as I want to be a lawyer in the future, </p>
<p>As for my family and friends, they describe me as a popular leader who takes charge whenever I work in a team. My teammates comment that I am pretty relaxed in general, however, sometimes its easy for me to lose my patience since I always set high standards for both my friends and myself; if someone fails my expectations in the team I will lose my temper, but I can soon recover control in order to encourage my teammates.</p>
<p>In addition, I am proud of some of my qualities, and the most important one is perseverence. No matter what difficulties I meet, even if I feel defeated from time to time I can still stand up and fight back; not only in school affairs but also in boxing, chess and writing.</p>
<p>In addition to these qualities, I also have a special understanding of credit capital which has affected the world economy recently. My interest in as well as my analysis of political affairs make me different from my peers; since I can organize my ideas rapidly with a clear logical link. I consider that to have thoughts on world matters should be encouraged. Moreover, I can use my flair for analysis when I read articles in The Economist or New York Times. Looking for flaws in logic in these publications is one of my favorite hobbies. </p>
<p>All in all, I admire those authors whose articles are published in world famous newspapers, and I have the desire to become one of them some day. I like to think about a problem from different perspectives, therefore, if there is a debate, I will be a good debater for both sides due to my study of dialecticThe art of determining the truth by the logical exchange of ideas and opinions is a basic need for a good counsel as well.</p>
