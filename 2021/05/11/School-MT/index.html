        <p>May it please the court, the opposing counsel, members of the jury.</p>
<p>Honestly Speaking, the defense also believes the kidnap left the victim with trauma mentally and physically. Nobody in this courtroom ever doubted the severity of this tragedy. However, facing such calamity, our emotions may overwhelm our reason. The defendant will not let that happen. Our job is to figure out the facts and follow the law instruction. Sinclair, a charitarian who donated $40000 to the school science lab generously, helped several kids who suffered from family pressure and childhood shadow, how could he kidnap a kid, Kiran, who shared the same experience with him? Although according to the truth and the law, Sinclair didn’t commit the crime of kidnapping, this ridiculous accuse will ruin this young student’s reputation, development, and future. We had seen the tragedy of Kiran, and we don’t want another tragedy to come to his innocent friend. He had donated his finance and energy to society, and this time his effort should return on him.</p>
<p>Today, we the defense bear no burden of proof and didn’t have to prove anything. The prosecution bears the burden. As they have charged Sinclair with the crime, they must bear the burden in the criminal justice system. They must prove their case beyond any reasonable doubt. They not only must prove that Sinclair kidnapped Kiran T, but that Sinclair intended to kidnap him. And also all the preparation such as email sending and drug dealing was made just by Sinclair himself.</p>
<p>The first reasonable doubt raised by us is that Jaden Sinclair was at the concert.<br>Our witness, Jaden Sinclair, had provided a firm alibi that at the night of the kidnap, he was in his room watching TV since the leader of the party had come for him to tell all the kids to go back home.<br>State back to the evidence, the victim was found inside Sinclair’s truck, but he even did not have the car keys around him, and the keys are not found till now. We can make a reasonable hypothesis: someone stole Sinclair’s car and kidnap Kiran. Moreover, it’s very ridiculous for Sinclair to send blackmail to Kiran. Firstly, Sinclair can’t send such mail since he didn’t even have the address of Kiran’s mail. Secondly, there’s no motivation for him to ask for 250000$ from Kiran. Sinclair owns independent economic capacity, he even refused $1500 from Kiran to pay for the party cars. Thirdly, the modus operandi was rather immature because it’s very easy to find Kiran in the trunk and does no real harm to him. </p>
<p>Our victim, Kiran, who experienced the whole process, has claimed that the person who kidnapped him was not Sinclair. He has proved that Sinclair was the one who saved him, not the one who hurt him. Also, Kiran mentioned that Sinclair and he communicated on the phone instead of by email. On the night of the party, Kiran indeed got a little drunk, but he is an adult now and it’s able for him to drink some wine. In addition, he received the retreated money from Sinclair, which confirmed that Sinclair did not intend to get money from kids.</p>
<p>From the telling of Sinclair and Kiran, we’ve shown the firm alibi and lack of motivation on the night of the kidnap.</p>
<p>We would like to further doubt the testimony of Cleo Taufique and Shae Reynolds.</p>
<p>Initially, from what Kiran’s parent, Cleo Taufique had testified, she pushed her son very hard at his young age. She ignored a teenager’s normal social demands and gave him pressure. Therefore, just before the year that Kiran will go to university, he showed signs of being anxiety and phobia. She even threw his book into the trash without talking to him, how can she expected Kiran to communicate with her? Just because of the failure of such communication as a parent should do to her child, Cleo Taufique failed to understand her son. (临场补充）</p>
<p>Moreover, the witness from the prosecution, Shae Reynolds, didn’t provide enough evidence to arrest Sinclair in jail. Although Kiran was found in the trunk, the remote control was missing and still missing till now. The ransom note was sent by an anonymous address that was just created, and the PDA itself was fraudulent and there was no evidence to identify its register. Although Kiran ingested in GHB and may lose his memory,  there’s no evidence to prove that it was Sinclair who put the GHB into his glass. Although Sinclair’s funds had been dwindling rapidly, he had a house with 4000 square feet with a detached three-car garage. (临场补充）There is no firm evidence to prove that Sinclair kidnapped Kiran, and intend to do so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we defendant would like to raise another doubt of imputation from 3 perspectives.<br>As Detective Reynolds mentioned, the organization was seemed to be a cult due to the members shave their heads and wear white cloth, but this was not Sinclair’s idea. Secondly, on the night of the prom, everyone was in Sinclair’s house, so anyone could put GHB in his room secretly or stole his car key. Thirdly, the ransom note’s email address was just created, which can be made by anyone who familiar with Sinclair and Kiran. Sinclair had proved all the members’ names to the detective, but she ignored and did not record them down due to her personal bias and experience. All of the members believed Sinclair would not harm Kiran, even the victim himself. To say the least, Jaden Sinclair had owned an organization in which everyone trusts each other, why he broke it and using such a ridiculous conspiracy? Does it make sense? The defense may reasonably doubt that the whole process was only a clumsy imputation made by who wants to make trouble to Sinclair and harm Kiran.</p>
<p>Your Honor, we want to emphasize that the prosecutor needs to solve all 3 reasonable doubts raised by us. The prosecutor failed your honor, Sinclair was simply an innocent donator who wants to return to society. As Kiran has been harmed so much by mental pressure from his parent and such an event, why would we harm him again? For Sinclair, he still needs to keep his investigation wor. He would use his money and foundation to help more people that suffered. However, this innocent<br>university student was facing a ridiculous felony charge today. He had donated his finance and energy to society, and this time his effort should return on him. Your honor, please save Sinclair’s<br>reputation and future. Please find Skyler Sinclair not guilty of the crime of kidnapping.</p>
