            <p>What is terrorism? Before we get into the details of everything, I think we need to be clear about our topic. The study of terrorism is currently limited by the lack of consistency in the definition of what constitutes a terrorist act and a terrorist organisation, with some scholars arguing for some consistency in the criteria. Some scholars argue for consistency in criteria, others use the ideal typology of terrorism, and still others continue to believe that these debates are ultimately inconclusive. The most direct explanation is, Terrorism is commonly classified as “violence or the threat of violence against persons or property to intimidate a government or civilian population in pursuit of apolitical, social, economic, or religious goal” (refer from FBI 2005). and all of these arguments came after the a terrorist——the 9/11.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/h3QL7Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/28/h3QL7Q.jpg" alt="h3QL7Q.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Throughout the whole event of 911 was high concerned by the whole society from 2001 till now and its left many people with horror impressions. The shadow of such event still exists. When the media focused on 911 a lot, writing about the big news, reporting and analyzing the facts, reassuring the families of the victims and survivors, the film industry didn’t just stop either. The films centered on 9/11 were no longer entertainment, but serious documents. The whole city is still deeply engulfed in horror, and even after a long time, people can’t forget it. The film helps to ease people’s emotions while allowing them to reflect in depth. Does the public have experience in facing terrorist organizations? Does the government have emergency measures in place? We should look fear in the face, face it and address it, rather than just avoid it.</p>
<p>The best approach to answer the essay’s reserach question, which is the following, To what extent has the American film industry of 911 decreased the general American public towards the act of violence, required a number of data to analyze.</p>

            <p>Topic：Does the media have liberal bias?<br>Ideas: the answer is yes<br> Several aspects.<br>1 ultimated reasons: explain the nowadays society and media will have the bias, why its is inevitable in the background situation<br>Examples: job occupations data opinions </p>
<p>Let me begin by defining three terms to begin with today’s topic: what is objective in media? It means that you report a news without own political views or instincts slanting the story to one and another. It’s pretty hard, isn’t it? We all had intentions to write about things. While nowadays mainstream media, especially for those which had international influence, tended to have literally biased in their opinions.</p>
<p> Let us take America as an example. We can count on the mainstream newspaper such as New York Times, The economics, CNN, LA Times, etc. But thinking of the right wing media, the most famous one would be The fox. From the above data, it seems that there are more left-wing newspapers than right-wing newspapers. There are several social contextual reasons why I say that the left-leaning of the American media is inevitable.</p>
<p>First, the trend of intellectual currents in modern American society is generally politically correct, which means that in practice people are limited in expressing their views. I’m not going to presume to talk about American politics here, but in such a social context, newspapers also tend to cater more to the views and tastes of the public. From a media science point of view, neutral coverage of a big event does not attract an audience - the event itself is dead, but people are alive. There are many different ways to cover the same event, and the fastest topping hot story must also carry strong emotions - resonating with the audience, making the reader feel strong emotions and thus identify with: the point of view, the author’s point of view, the view of the party represented.</p>
<p>I will give some examples to demonstrate this below. During President Bush’s party administration, the media had shamelessly glorified Cindy Sheehan. In creating story, she was charactized as a poor woman who wanted to see president Bush because her son passed away in the war of Iraq. However, she actually on the other side and in favor of the Iraqi. Well now you can see even in my speech there is bias. The mainstream media has the power to make the story big, and till now when you search on the chrome, Cindy Sheehan is treated as the anti-activist of America.</p>
<p>Also, for the passage of New York time which posted before the presidential election in Oct 2020, has posted about the achievements when Trump was on the stage. In the article, the author claimed that from 2016 to 2020, the number of racists risen, the criminals increased, but he failed to give any data to prove his idea——he gave out tondruas of opinions, of how bad was Trump, however we cannot let the emotions  overwhelm our reason: are there anybody would admit themselves as a “racist?” if not, what events can defined as racialism, and how to do the statistics? Think about them and you will find loads of problem.  </p>
<p>One editor of the Fox who worked there for more than 20 years told a story about his student, we will call him A here. A was graduated from a prominent university, and his educational attainment filled the requirement. While the interviewer asked him about his political background, he stated that he supported the right wing and pitied, he failed to get that job. I am not saying this ain’t correct, because a company has the right to select the people who shared same value with them, but still this evidence can prove that, we do things, write things, with our opinion, with our bias.</p>

            <p>This summer, I was the tutor for our mock trial team. This is the first official time that I led a new team to the city tournament, facing the opponents from all over the country, I got much pressure. I taught them all the rules and skills for a long time, we prepared for the moment since the winter holiday(online tournament), and it’s new for them to debate in the real court. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/ftt9Gn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/ftt9Gn.jpg" alt="ftt9Gn.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Before the night of the competition, I discussed with them about the acting skill for the witness. Actually, I was a bit concern for my juniors. Last year when I went to the MT tournament with my team, we researched for the whole night of those objections. No one instruct us about the rules of evidence, and we had to learn by ourselves. However, through our efforts and combined with the past experience, the objections lists were made by us, at least I am very familiar with the basic rules. While for our juniors, they used the files directly without thinking about why.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/ftYOr8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/ftYOr8.jpg" alt="ftYOr8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We had Tencent meeting online several times, I made screenshot for my notes but they seemed still have difficulties to memorize the rule of evidence. On the night I was very nervous, but pretended that I was fine. It was even more nervous than the time of last year. I looked upon their files and read through them, those direct examinations, cross, impeachment, which written beautifully on their little cards, a delight lightened inside of me.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fttPx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/fttPx0.jpg" alt="fttPx0.jpg"></a></p>
<p> Finally I told myself tomorrow will not be counted into the score, I should not help them fix their problems in the DX or CX. They ought to find them by themselves, at least experienced the feelings of being objections on court. I can handle the objections (especially for the experts) because last winter, I was aggressively objected by my opposing counsels. I remembered such feeling till now, failed to say nothing on court and waited until the time passed by, totally embarrassed not only me but also my teammates. After that, I was even keener to do expert witnesses. I will grow up where I fail.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/ftY4Ve" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/ftY4Ve.jpg" alt="ftY4Ve.jpg"></a></p>
<p>（this is the practose time when we selected the new team)</p>

            <p>2021, a year of unfortunate, when everyone expected the void-19 to go well, it recrudescence again in summer. I won’t do comments on the policy of our government(you know why), I only knew on that melancholy afternoon, when the rain was falling, all of us had to do coved test. Despite this, my Mock trial tournament was cancelled. The administration banned Nanjing citizens to go outside our city.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/WIA4VU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/07/27/WIA4VU.jpg" alt="WIA4VU.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I prepared this Mock trial tournament for about a month. My team mates and I wrote the direction examination previously and recited them. We tried to build our own character evidence. For this, I even learnt the French accent in speaking English and bought delicate clothes, just to suit the character well. Also, as the defense attorney, we managed to create a case theme. Beside, the case law was used by our team to research for the problem. Although I have been participated in MT for two years, I got to know what is “battery case” for the first time.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed when the announcement came out. None of our team member have ever been to the airport where the covid was found. All of us passed the covid test twice, but we still not allowed to go to other cities. But I think I should get used to such things, since you can’t expect everything goes well with you. </p>
<p>The following text are my drafts.</p>

            <p>A1: Good Morning/Afternoon, Ms Arnould, would you please state your name for the record</p>
<p>W1: S-A-M A-R-N-O-U-L-D</p>
<p>A2: Could you please briefly introduce yourself ?</p>
<p>W2: Sure, I used to work in kitchens in France and then I went to Midland to set up my business. I start my food servicing business in 2015. Initially we had a hard time, even facing bankrupt crisis. Things change in 2016. Our business boosts after working with him. </p>
<p>A3：He being?</p>
<p>W3: Harper Martini, owner of Peony Estates. We organized the Peony River Anniversary party together. <strong>C’est magnifique!</strong> Oh, in English, the party was really great. Harper becomes my most important client. </p>
<p>A: Most important (Restate)</p>
<p>W3: Yeah, most important. (Nodding) I got much income from Harper. Personally, I am gratitude to him. </p>
<p>A4: All right, lets talk about Casey’s wedding. How did you get involved?</p>
<p>W4: Well, in late 2018, Harper asked me to cater Casey’s wedding and also the rehearsal night before the wedding. So, I visited Peony Estates to further discussed with Harper. Well, when I visit the kitchen at the Estate, the sanitation their was TOTALLY unacceptable </p>
<p>A5: Why would you say that?</p>
<p>W5: When I entered the kitchen, I saw Harper just throw the pesticide sprayer into the corner of the kitchen. As a chef, I knew Kitchen was never a place to store pesticide. So I reminded Harper. </p>
<p>A6: And what happened next?</p>
<p>W6: He took the pesticide sprayer towards the bottling areas. Keeping pesticides in the kitchen or besides the wines didn’t make any sense at all. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/W2HZTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/07/25/W2HZTA.jpg" alt="W2HZTA.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>[Only If Austin Lewis is present**</strong> </p>
<p>W6: (Continued)Well actually there is a explanation for that pesticide in the kitchen in the kitchen. </p>
<p>A6.1: What that explanation?</p>
<p>W6.1: Peony Estate may want to spread the pesticides indoor to kill the pests. I have received a memo about spreading pesticides.  </p>
<p>(A approach Exhibition 10 to bench and opposing party)</p>
<p>A6.2: Do you recognized this exhibit.</p>
<p>W6.2: Yes, it’s the memo that Austin Lewis sent to the employee at Peony Estates.</p>
<p>A6.3: How do you know this exhibit?</p>
<p>W6.3: Austin Lewis accidentally sent this email to me. </p>
<p>(A enter exhibition)</p>
<p>A6.4: What was the content of the memo.</p>
<p>W6.4: Austin approved the use of chemical pesticide inside the building. And he instructed the worker to finish spreading quickly. “If we don’t get the spraying done by the end of the month, we will have no choice but to engage in layoffs” (Read the email )</p>
<p>A6.5: You’ve mentioned “end of the month”, so when was this memo sent?</p>
<p>W6.5: Well. Here it is: July the 1, 2018. So Austin Lewis instructed the workers to spread pesticides inside in July, 2018. </p>
<p>A6.6: And when did you see Harper put the pesticides in November?</p>
<p>W6.6: It’s in November. Oh, wait! At that time they must finished spraying pesticides indoor. But Harper still put pesticide sprayer inside the kitchen. I have no idea why he do so. </p>
<p>(A retrieve exhibit )]</p>
<p>A7: What happened after you visiting the kitchen.</p>
<p>W7: We found a space to talked about the menu. I wanted to directly discuss the menu. But our discussion was really tough and was not productive at all</p>
<p>A8: Why was the discussion so tough?</p>
<p>W8: Harper always wanted to talked about Genesis, complaining how Genesis was selfish and immature. I wanted to focus on the menu, but he didn’t stop complaining and became more and more anxious. So the conversation stuck and wait Harper to calm down.</p>
<p>A9: And what happened after he calmed down?</p>
<p>W9: I was told that Blaire Osborne would be the wedding planner. So I decided to worked with Blaire directly and began to leave. When I was leaving Harper became really angry.</p>
<p>A10: How can you tell Harper was really angry?</p>
<p>W10: He slammed a bowl down, shouting “anyone but Genesis, literally anyone!”. After I left, I discussed with Blaire and we decided to held a rehearsal dinner”</p>
<p>A11: Oh, that sounds great! So how is it going.</p>
<p>W11: It goes pretty well. Everyone enjoyed the food. </p>
<p>[<strong><em>\</em>(*****</strong>*Only If Dr. Cannon is Present)****</p>
<p>W11(continued): Well not exactly everyone, Genesis refused to try the Shrimp. </p>
<p>A11.1: So what’s your response,</p>
<p>W11.1: I heard a voice said: “It’s okay, you can tell them you’re allergic”. I don’t know whether Genesis was truly allergic to shrimps. But to keep anyone from danger of allergy, I took  </p>
<p>] </p>
<p><strong>(**</strong>I am not sure whether we should discuss the voice mail. Although Sam heard the voice mail, he didn’t recognized exhibit 8 the voice mail. Angel also mentioned the voicemail and she recognized exhibit 8. May be discuss with Iris about who should address the voicemail -Francis)**</p>
<p>A12: All rights. Let’s talked about the rehearsal dinner. How did you prepared for it?</p>
<p>W12: I went to the kitchen at 11 a.m. to talk with Harper. When I arrived, he was working with several bottles. All of the bottles are labelled Horizon, most popular wines in Peony Estate. Well, except one bottle. </p>
<p>A13: So, what’s that bottle?</p>
<p>W13: It was labelled as 2019 Cara. Though having visited the Estate several times, I’ve never heard or seen Cara before. Harper said this unique unreleased wine was ONLY for Genesis</p>
<p>A: Only for Genesis</p>
<p>W13: Yes, Cara only for Genesis. Harper then asked whether I could brought bottles to guests later.</p>
<p>A14: And what’s your response?</p>
<p>W14: I agreed for sure. Harper then reiterated that the bottle of Cara had to go to Genesis while everyone else would get a bottle of Horizon again. I decided to left and noticed something strange. </p>
<p>A15: So what exactly did you notice? </p>
<p>W15: I noticed a canister of pesticide on the kitchen’s corner. When asked why it was there, Harper said “To kill pests like Genesis! Just kidding, of course.” </p>
<p>A16: Oh… Apart from “to kill pest like Genesis”, what else did he say?</p>
<p>W16: He just left that sentence. As he said, maybe he just kidding, but he DID mention “To kill pest like Genesis”. By the way, I also noticed some corks in the kitchen. But spare corks in Peony Estates is not special. </p>
<p>A17: Why did you say that spare corks is not special?</p>
<p>W17: Sometimes, I saw workers cork and recork a SINGLE bottle in the KITCHEN. But, eh, I was not sure if they corked or uncorked any bottle in the kitchen. Yeah, not sure about it. </p>
<p>A18: Why are you not sure about whether they corked the bottles?</p>
<p>W18: I was really busy that day and I couldn’t pay attention to the bottles. Since I don’t pay attention, it is possible that someone uncorked and recorked any bottles, including Cara without getting my notice. </p>
<p>A19: All right, lets talked about the night on the rehearsal dining. What did you do that night?</p>
<p>W19: As promised to Harper, I presented the Cara to Genesis. Harper himself poured a glass of Cara. At that time, everyone drank a glass of champagne that night. I left to prepare tomorrows wedding around 10:15 p.m. But tomorrow morning I heard about the death of Genesis. </p>
<p>A20: How did you feel about his death. </p>
<p>W20: I am really guilty as I fear the food or the drink caused Genesis’s death. However, no one else got ill after eating my food or drinking Champagne I offered. I was relieved. But still, the wedding was ruined and we lost Genesis forever. </p>
