            <p>I lived in the world of night<br> Of where river washes hollow in spring<br>And the moon glittered in the gentlest delight<br> Like the water blows your mind</p>
<p>I wanna peer over the edge and see the butterflies<br> To see if we are the same as we should be like human beings<br>To get rid of a dream of naked and pretty lies<br>Which so many of them hold like a relief.</p>
<p>I held a nature love of the universal nature before we burn<br> A love like Aphrodite to love the constellation<br>If all the time is eternally present when it’s my turn<br>May be I would walk into the perpetual garden without an invitation.</p>
<p>Now you might think I was fulfilled by the fantasies<br> But when I opened my hand and feel the cold rain<br>It is the true reality all around me like the mist kisses<br>I have told you so, I loved all and all in everything.</p>

<p>The newly released movie “Free Guy” exceeded my expectations. I thought it was just a well-conceived entertainment movie, but after watching it, it caused me to think. People play the game Free City where the players all wear ‘sunglasses’ and the NPCs can only see the scenes set within the game. Finally, one day, an NPC awakened to self-awareness: why am I set to live like this? NPCs in the game are bullied by players every day, such as being robbed of banks, killed, etc. These are all tasks of the players. This seems to be the mechanics of the game, but projected into reality, we will find the connection between the two.</p>
<p>In fact, in reality, we often live our lives the same way all over the days, repeat and repeat. Get up in the morning, go to work, do the same thing every day, go home from work, have fun, and then start a new day. Have we ever wondered why life is so set in stone? I had this complaint when I was a student.</p>
<p>I think the glasses in the movie represent the “information gap”. After NPC Guy grabbed a pair of glasses, he realized that the world in front of him was completely different from his own: gold coins floating on the street, medical kits… considering about there are people in your life see more things than you… they definitely have a better life.</p>
<p>From another perspective, the movie director may also do evaluation of the society. Are people with glasses can just hurt other people? Is it right for powerful guys do whatever they want to normal people?</p>
<p>The answer is no. But how many of them have enjoyed their privilege and hurting others? We have to find our own values, otherwise we just the NPCs for the world of ‘game’.</p>

            <p>It’s hard for me to think that laws exist in a place like Afghanistan, or that there are places in the world that are so backward and centralized. It is also because the Taliban is in power that I am concerned about the country. The U.S. military has withdrawn from Afghanistan in disarray. When the troops retreated, many Afghans wanted to get on planes, even if they died, rather than stay in a country where the Taliban were in power. This reminds me of what I learned about Rwanda in my history books. 1994, the United Nation withdrew from the Taliban. They originally wanted to keep the peace in Rwanda, but when they got to the front line, they realized that they could not intervene in internal affairs except for self-defense. In my opinion a similar historical event is repeating itself. </p>
<p> <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/49k0eA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/12/49k0eA.jpg" alt="49k0eA.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The question is: what kind of power can fight against centralized power? I don’t think democracy can exist in such a place. Because people do not take the responsibility to protect the country, they naturally will not be responsible for this country. Democracy used to belong to a minority. Of course, in a modern society, especially a stable situation, where people have stable jobs and houses, such a society is suitable for overall democracy. But for backward countries, democracy would be a nightmare. From a realistic point of view, Afghanistan does not even have laws anymore. I mean, modern developed laws. The current system in Afghanistan can only be considered as traditional or oppression under strong power. The streets are filled with guns, the status of women is once again degraded, they have to wear black veil on the street and banned to receive education. They cannot work. Cannot communicate with even strangers.And it is legal to be domestically abused.</p>
<p>I believe that the current Afghanistan is a society where the law of the jungle is enforced.</p>
<p> I hope things will go well in the future. </p>

            <p>This is related to my Extend Essay about terrorism, the 9.11 event. The terrorism” label has both broad and specific implications when it is applied. Altheide (2006) found that terrorism goes beyond a simple narrative, rather when an incident is labeled as terrorism, it becomes the definition of the situation. This framing of violence creates a sense that all Americans are potential victims of evil terrorists, and the military are portrayed as our protectors against terrorist violence. </p>
<p>The idea then arises to use torture on terrorists to make them punishable or to force them to reveal their plans for the rest of their terrorist acts. However, there is no current international law that supports such an act. We cannot be sure that some countries are privy to lynchings, but in general, the torture of terrorists is generally condemned.</p>
<p>There are many scholars who are calling for the legalization of the punishment of terrorists. They give theories and they give arguments. They cite an extreme example: If a plane is threatened to crash, should a knowing terrorist be tortured into telling the truth? If there are more than a hundred people on this one plane, are their lives not worthy of being cared for?</p>
<p>This example seems reasonable at first glance, but it is not without its flaws. First, the conditions are such that the probability of such a terrorist event is very small. Second, we cannot be sure that a terrorist with an informed plan could be captured under such conditions. Assuming these conditions are met, there is no guarantee that the terrorist is telling the truth. People tend to lie under pressure. If you can only use torture to extract a confession, then the likelihood of him lying is also very high. In principle, the probability of saving a planeload of people becomes much smaller.</p>
<p>In addition, modern society has provided a lot of technology. The use of torture is indeed one way, but it is barbaric and primitive. One doctor said that using torture on them would reduce us morally to the same kind of people as them, which is not fundamentally different. People are turning themselves into what they fear. There is an old Chinese saying, “A gentleman is far from the kitchen,” and one might ask, is it unjust for us to simply acquiesce to such actions?</p>
<p>I cannot give an answer. But legalizing torture obviously requires a lot of discussion. The law cannot yet be fully controlled by human beings, let alone directly disposing of the lives of others. In principle we do not have the right to do so, but reality is often not what it should be, and ideal ideologies cannot always be put into action.</p>

            <p>What is terrorism? Before we get into the details of everything, I think we need to be clear about our topic. The study of terrorism is currently limited by the lack of consistency in the definition of what constitutes a terrorist act and a terrorist organisation, with some scholars arguing for some consistency in the criteria. Some scholars argue for consistency in criteria, others use the ideal typology of terrorism, and still others continue to believe that these debates are ultimately inconclusive. The most direct explanation is, Terrorism is commonly classified as “violence or the threat of violence against persons or property to intimidate a government or civilian population in pursuit of apolitical, social, economic, or religious goal” (refer from FBI 2005). and all of these arguments came after the a terrorist——the 9/11.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/h3QL7Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/28/h3QL7Q.jpg" alt="h3QL7Q.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Throughout the whole event of 911 was high concerned by the whole society from 2001 till now and its left many people with horror impressions. The shadow of such event still exists. When the media focused on 911 a lot, writing about the big news, reporting and analyzing the facts, reassuring the families of the victims and survivors, the film industry didn’t just stop either. The films centered on 9/11 were no longer entertainment, but serious documents. The whole city is still deeply engulfed in horror, and even after a long time, people can’t forget it. The film helps to ease people’s emotions while allowing them to reflect in depth. Does the public have experience in facing terrorist organizations? Does the government have emergency measures in place? We should look fear in the face, face it and address it, rather than just avoid it.</p>
<p>The best approach to answer the essay’s reserach question, which is the following, To what extent has the American film industry of 911 decreased the general American public towards the act of violence, required a number of data to analyze.</p>

            <p>Topic：Does the media have liberal bias?<br>Ideas: the answer is yes<br> Several aspects.<br>1 ultimated reasons: explain the nowadays society and media will have the bias, why its is inevitable in the background situation<br>Examples: job occupations data opinions </p>
<p>Let me begin by defining three terms to begin with today’s topic: what is objective in media? It means that you report a news without own political views or instincts slanting the story to one and another. It’s pretty hard, isn’t it? We all had intentions to write about things. While nowadays mainstream media, especially for those which had international influence, tended to have literally biased in their opinions.</p>
<p> Let us take America as an example. We can count on the mainstream newspaper such as New York Times, The economics, CNN, LA Times, etc. But thinking of the right wing media, the most famous one would be The fox. From the above data, it seems that there are more left-wing newspapers than right-wing newspapers. There are several social contextual reasons why I say that the left-leaning of the American media is inevitable.</p>
<p>First, the trend of intellectual currents in modern American society is generally politically correct, which means that in practice people are limited in expressing their views. I’m not going to presume to talk about American politics here, but in such a social context, newspapers also tend to cater more to the views and tastes of the public. From a media science point of view, neutral coverage of a big event does not attract an audience - the event itself is dead, but people are alive. There are many different ways to cover the same event, and the fastest topping hot story must also carry strong emotions - resonating with the audience, making the reader feel strong emotions and thus identify with: the point of view, the author’s point of view, the view of the party represented.</p>
<p>I will give some examples to demonstrate this below. During President Bush’s party administration, the media had shamelessly glorified Cindy Sheehan. In creating story, she was charactized as a poor woman who wanted to see president Bush because her son passed away in the war of Iraq. However, she actually on the other side and in favor of the Iraqi. Well now you can see even in my speech there is bias. The mainstream media has the power to make the story big, and till now when you search on the chrome, Cindy Sheehan is treated as the anti-activist of America.</p>
<p>Also, for the passage of New York time which posted before the presidential election in Oct 2020, has posted about the achievements when Trump was on the stage. In the article, the author claimed that from 2016 to 2020, the number of racists risen, the criminals increased, but he failed to give any data to prove his idea——he gave out tondruas of opinions, of how bad was Trump, however we cannot let the emotions  overwhelm our reason: are there anybody would admit themselves as a “racist?” if not, what events can defined as racialism, and how to do the statistics? Think about them and you will find loads of problem.  </p>
<p>One editor of the Fox who worked there for more than 20 years told a story about his student, we will call him A here. A was graduated from a prominent university, and his educational attainment filled the requirement. While the interviewer asked him about his political background, he stated that he supported the right wing and pitied, he failed to get that job. I am not saying this ain’t correct, because a company has the right to select the people who shared same value with them, but still this evidence can prove that, we do things, write things, with our opinion, with our bias.</p>

            <p>This summer, I was the tutor for our mock trial team. This is the first official time that I led a new team to the city tournament, facing the opponents from all over the country, I got much pressure. I taught them all the rules and skills for a long time, we prepared for the moment since the winter holiday(online tournament), and it’s new for them to debate in the real court. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/ftt9Gn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/ftt9Gn.jpg" alt="ftt9Gn.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Before the night of the competition, I discussed with them about the acting skill for the witness. Actually, I was a bit concern for my juniors. Last year when I went to the MT tournament with my team, we researched for the whole night of those objections. No one instruct us about the rules of evidence, and we had to learn by ourselves. However, through our efforts and combined with the past experience, the objections lists were made by us, at least I am very familiar with the basic rules. While for our juniors, they used the files directly without thinking about why.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/ftYOr8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/ftYOr8.jpg" alt="ftYOr8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We had Tencent meeting online several times, I made screenshot for my notes but they seemed still have difficulties to memorize the rule of evidence. On the night I was very nervous, but pretended that I was fine. It was even more nervous than the time of last year. I looked upon their files and read through them, those direct examinations, cross, impeachment, which written beautifully on their little cards, a delight lightened inside of me.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fttPx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/fttPx0.jpg" alt="fttPx0.jpg"></a></p>
<p> Finally I told myself tomorrow will not be counted into the score, I should not help them fix their problems in the DX or CX. They ought to find them by themselves, at least experienced the feelings of being objections on court. I can handle the objections (especially for the experts) because last winter, I was aggressively objected by my opposing counsels. I remembered such feeling till now, failed to say nothing on court and waited until the time passed by, totally embarrassed not only me but also my teammates. After that, I was even keener to do expert witnesses. I will grow up where I fail.</p>

<p>（this is the practose time when we selected the new team)</p>

            <p>2021, a year of unfortunate, when everyone expected the void-19 to go well, it recrudescence again in summer. I won’t do comments on the policy of our government(you know why), I only knew on that melancholy afternoon, when the rain was falling, all of us had to do coved test. Despite this, my Mock trial tournament was cancelled. The administration banned Nanjing citizens to go outside our city.</p>

<p>I prepared this Mock trial tournament for about a month. My team mates and I wrote the direction examination previously and recited them. We tried to build our own character evidence. For this, I even learnt the French accent in speaking English and bought delicate clothes, just to suit the character well. Also, as the defense attorney, we managed to create a case theme. Beside, the case law was used by our team to research for the problem. Although I have been participated in MT for two years, I got to know what is “battery case” for the first time.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed when the announcement came out. None of our team member have ever been to the airport where the covid was found. All of us passed the covid test twice, but we still not allowed to go to other cities. But I think I should get used to such things, since you can’t expect everything goes well with you. </p>
<p>The following text are my drafts.</p>
